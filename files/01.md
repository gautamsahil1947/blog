The developer community is very friendly. I asked some unneccessary stupid questions as I got into the
irc channel (a group for chatting, more about it later), but they were very generous to not shout at me. They
welcomed me, asked about whether was I able to build LO (short for libreoffice) or not, and shared resources
to cite, and later one of the mentors mailed me, and he answered my queries.

## Step 00: Join the IRC channel (basically a chat group)

**Question:** What is IRC? <br>
**Answer:** Search on the internet. <br>

**Question:** How to join? <br>
**Answer:** Demonstrated In [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whHBiTwstWI) very nicely?

- Simple rules
  - Be polite and patient.
  - Directly ask your queries. And wait for atleast 60 minutes before leaving
  - Better is if you have put in some effort before asking, need not have worked out, but try first.

## Step 01: Building libreoffice on your machine

So most of the times when we install some packages or programms using either some package manager on linux or
using the exe installer on widows, we are installing the precompiled binaries or the programms. Building is
different. <br> Building means

- Cloning the sourcecode on your local machine.
- Installing all the dependencies required to compile the program.
- Setting up the compiler
- And the compilation process (**It takes time**)

Because the compilation of programs takes anywhere from minuts to hours, based on which program you are
installing (compiliing), what the developers do is that they compile it for various configurations/ operating
systems, and put the binaries on the package manager repositories. <br>

For the newbies, it is always advised to first watch [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whHBiTwstWI), by one of the developers. It makes
the situation a lot more comfortable, or so I felt in my case. May be you are a smart person, and if you
feel so, then it's upto you. <br>

In [the tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whHBiTwstWI), they mention some links to the [libreoffice wiki](https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/), and others, which I have hunted and gathered
at the end of this document. I haven't mentioned those clone commands or repositories, as it is better to refer to
the [wiki](https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/) and get used to it. I strongly suggest giving an hour or two to the wiki first, so that you get an idea
of the resources available.

## Step 02: Setting up gerrit.

What is gerrit, I thought at first. Maybe now I know about it. From what I have understood,
libreoffice, gerrit is a code review tool, which makes it easy for the developers to manage the changes being pushed
by hundereds of people.<br>

- create a gerrit account
- setup ssh keys. (similar to github)
- use the `./logerrit test` command to check the connection
- better refer to the [wiki](https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/) or the tutorial above.

## Step 03: Killing your first bug üêõ

Make a [Bugzilla](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/) account. It is a platform where bugs are reported. Find a bug from the **EasyHacks**,
usually [tdf#143148](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=143148) is the easiest one to start with. Read the comments under the bug to get an idea about it.
Always make the changes in a seperate branch. Then you commit the changes, and submit them, again refer to the wiki for that.
<br>

This triggers a build process with jenkins (an automation tool used by LO which compiles the code with your changes for all the platforms to check whether
the changes you made passed all the test cases or not.) Do note that sometimes because of some faulty testcase, your build might fail, which is not a problem
to worry about on your side, the libreoffice team will take care of that.
<br>

Then you cc a developer for reviewing your changes. The developer checks and if some change is required, they will let you know in the
comments. You make those changes.

**Question: How does the review system work?**

Read more about it on the wiki. But in a nutshell, jenkins will give you `+1` if your build passed all the testcases, and then the reviewer will give you `+2` points if
they were satisfied with your submissions. They(the reviewers) have commit access to the official repository, and so they will merge your
patch(part of code submitted by you, which changed some part of code in the repo). Do remember to mail the license statement to the mail id mentioned in the wiki.

## What next?

Well if you are a newbie like me, then you keep in touch with the developers, ask them if you are stuck, and find bugs that you can fix. Believe me, I expected
it to be like reddit or stackoverflow, and I couldn't have been more wrong.

Try to be of any use to the project. The why behind you being interested in it matters. You need to know about C++ .... (refer to [wiki](https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/)).

## My Progress

> Note that although I said that I will mention the resources below, turns out wiki has it all, and therefore do give some time
> to it. Plus you have the master key, the tutorial, where everyting (almost) is demonstrated

[This wiki page](https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/GetInvolved) has it all covered in detail.
learncpp.com for learning C++.
